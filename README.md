# Wish-TicTacToe
A wish version of TicTacToe having a casual GUI made by young Axel


## Features

  Graphical Interface using PyQt5
  Supports variable board sizes (default 5x5)
  Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
  Automatic draw detection
  Game reset after a win or draw

  

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
### Install Dependencies

```
pip install PyQt5
```

## How to Run

  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where TIC-TAC-TOE-app.py is located.
  Run the script using:
  
  ```
  python TIC-TAC-TOE-app.py
  ```

  The Tic-Tac-Toe game window will open.


## How to Play

  Players take turns clicking on an empty cell.
  The first player to align their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
  If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
  The game resets automatically after a win or draw.


## Demo



## Example Gameplay

  ```
  python TIC-TAC-TOE-app.py

  ```


## Future Improvements

  Add AI opponent for single-player mode
  Improve UI design with animations
  Allow different win conditions (e.g., 4-in-a-row on larger boards)
